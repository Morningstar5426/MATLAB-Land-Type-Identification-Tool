# MATLAB Land Type Identification Tool

I developed a tool to processes satellite imagery to identify predominant land types (e.g., grassland, desert, water) and simulate how these land types may evolve over time. Using a cellular automata approach, the system analyses pixel RGB values, classifies each pixel into a land type, and updates the classification over multiple iterations based on the states of neighbouring pixels.

To run this tool, simply open the Assignment.mlx file, go to the task overview section and press run to end in the live editor toolstrip.
